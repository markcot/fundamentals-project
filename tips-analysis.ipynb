    "Plotting the daily split of the meals and above statistics confirms that Lunch time is the main meal on Thursday, there are mixed meal times on Friday and the only meal time on Saturday and Sunday is Dinner time. Saturday is the slightly better day for total tips. Sundays tips are good also, but a few large tips on Saturday push it ahead. Total tips received on Friday is significantly lower compared to the other three days as there are much less meals served on Friday than on the other three days.\n",

    "- The main trade on Thursday is Lunch time, mixed on Friday and exclusively Dinner time on Saturday and Sunday\n",
    "- Saturday is best day and Friday is the worst for meal numbers served, tips and total_bill received\n",
    "- The majority of the table bill payers were non-smoking males (39.8%)\n",
    "- The majority of tables have 2 people per table.\n",
    "- A good guide for tip rate is 15% of total_bill or 1 dollar or more per person\n",
    "- Per person smokers on average tend to spend slightly more and tip slightly better than non-smokers"
