#### Introduction
This document is my marked down file for the GMIT module 'Fundamentals of Data Analysis' project. The project includes a review and analysis of the well-known 'tips' dataset. My analysis of the dataset is undertaken using a jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/), which is included in this repository as 'tips-analysis.ipynb'. This jupyter notebook utilises the Python programming language (https://www.python.org/) to analyse the dataset.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/markcot/fundamentals-project/blob/master/tips-analysis.ipynb?flush_cache=true. This GitHub repository https://github.com/markcot/fundamentals-project can be cloned to a local hard drive and run locally using jupyter notebook from the command line or terminal. When the notebook is first opened, the user should start by running all of code in the notebook. Select from the drop down option 'Restart & Run All' under the menu heading 'Kernel'. Note that I have made some of the plots larger so some toogling off of scrolling in the cells with plot may be required when initially rerunning the notebook.

The 'tips' dataset is already preloaded in the python seaborn module. A csv file of the tips dataset called 'tips.csv' is included in this repository for information. The source of this csv file is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv.

#### Project Plan

##### Setup
- Create and initialise the GitHub repository
- Create the jupyter notebook
- Load the csv

##### Description
- Undertake desk review of previous analysis of the database
- Describe the dataset variables
- Get ranges of numeric variables max, min, average, median
- Review % of smokers and % of males/females
- Review days of the week
- Display pairplot to further describe the variables

##### Regression
- Compare variables total_bill and tip
- Discuss the relationship between the variables
- Plot comparisons of data points
- Review distribution of tip/total_bill percentage
- Review variables total_bill, tip and their sum and whole number rounding

##### Analyse
- Based on the initial description select a number of interesting variables
- Undertake a detailed analyse of these variable relationships
- Review patterns in smokers versus non-smoker
- Review party size compared to total_bill and tip
- Review patterns in meal times and days of the week

##### Conclusion
- Summarise conclusions of the analysis
- Comparision result with other analysis
