#### Introduction
This document is my marked down file for the GMIT module 'Fundamentals of Data Analysis' project. The project includes a review and analysis of the well known 'tips' dataset. The analysis of the dataset is undertaken using a jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/), which is included in this repository as 'tips-analysis.ipynb'. The notebook utilises the python programming langauge (https://www.python.org/) to analyse the dataset.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed as a read only on the GitHub repository page https://github.com/markcot/fundamentals-project. This repository may be cloned to a local hard drive and run locally using jupyter notebook from the command line or terminal.

The 'tips' dataset is already preloaded in the python seaborn module. A csv file of the 'tips' dataset is included in this repository for information. The source of this csv file is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv.

#### Project Plan

##### Description
- Create and Initialise the GitHub repository
- Create the jupter notebook
- Load the csv
- Undertake desk review of previous anaylyse of the database
- Summarise the data variables
- Get ranges of variable max, min, average, outliers, etc.
- Display plots of the variables to further describe the variable

##### Regression
- Compare variables 'total bill' and 'tip' amount
- Discuss the relationship between the variables

##### Analyse
- Based on the initial description select a number of interesting variables
- Undertake a detailed analyse of these variable relationships

##### Conclusion
- Decribe the conclusion of the results.
